		<h2>The Story of Overwatch</h2>
		
		<p>Overwatch is set in a future where humanity has experienced a golden age of technology, only to be threatened by a crisis known as the Omnic War. AI-driven robots rebelled against their creators, leading to global conflict. In response, the United Nations formed Overwatch, a task force made up of the worldâ€™s greatest soldiers, scientists, and adventurers to restore peace and order.</p>

		<p>For years, Overwatch kept the world safe, but internal struggles and allegations of corruption led to its disbandment. However, as new threats emerged such as terrorist organizations like Talon, rogue omnics, and global instability. Former heroes and new recruits have answered the call once again. With Overwatch reassembled, the battle for the future has begun.</p>
